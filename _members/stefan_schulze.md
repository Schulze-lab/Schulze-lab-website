Originally from Germany, Stefan went to college at the University of Potsdam (B.Sc. in Biochemistry in 2010) and then did his PhD at the University of Muenster (M.Sc. in 2013, Ph.D. in 2017) before coming to the US as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania. During these times he worked on phage-bacteria interactions, microalgal proteomics, and archaeal biofilm formation â€“ with glycobiology as the connecting theme between these areas. With the beginning of the fall semester 2022, Stefan started his lab as an Assistant Professor in the School of Life Sciences at RIT.
