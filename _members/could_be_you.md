Are you interested in interdisciplinary research?
Do you like complex challenges?
The command line doesn't scare you and you might even have some programming experience?

Then shoot me an email or schedule a meeting through [calendly](https://calendly.com/schulze-lab) to discuss potential projects that fit your interests and experience.
