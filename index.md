# Deciphering the Roles of Glycoproteins in Prokaryotes

{% include section.html %}

{% include banner.html image="images/banner.jpg" %}

Protein glycosylation, an inherent trait of all forms of life on Earth, is crucial for a multitude of cellular processes. Yet, for most prokaryotes little is known about which proteins are glycosylated, and how this modification is involved in their cell biology. Given the importance of prokaryotes as the cause of various human diseases, and as beneficial actors in microbiomes and biotechnology, research in the Schulze lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology advances our understanding of the roles of prokaryotic glycoproteins.

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
The complexity and diversity of protein glycosylation in prokaryotes complicate their analysis. Therefore, we use an interdisciplinary approach, which combines bioinformatics, proteomics, and cell biological assays for the functional, syste-wide analysis of glycoproteins.
